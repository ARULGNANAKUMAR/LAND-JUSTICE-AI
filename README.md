# 🏛️ Land Justice AI

### AI-Powered Land Fraud Detection & Citizen Protection Platform

> Transforming land records into actionable intelligence using AI, 3D visualization, and geospatial analytics.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Land Justice AI** is a next-generation land intelligence platform that detects fraud using geospatial visualization, explainable AI, and ownership pattern analysis.

It is designed as a **dual-mode system**:

* 🏛️ **Government Mode** – Land monitoring and fraud intelligence dashboard
* 👨‍👩‍👧 **Citizen Mode** – Simple tools for families to detect property fraud early

The platform converts complex land records into intuitive visual insights, helping identify suspicious ownership patterns and prevent manipulation.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Land fraud and ownership manipulation affect millions of families due to:

* Joint ownership disputes
* Forced transfers
* Post-death mutations
* Undervalued transactions
* Lack of legal awareness

Existing portals track land — but they **don’t detect fraud patterns intelligently**.

---

## 💡 Solution

Land Justice AI introduces:

* 🧠 AI-based fraud risk scoring
* 🌍 3D geospatial visualization
* 📊 Ownership timeline reconstruction
* 🔍 Explainable risk analysis
* ❤️ Citizen-first safety tools

The platform bridges the gap between **government land monitoring** and **citizen protection**.
